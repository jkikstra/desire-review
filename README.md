## Root folder
### Folders

`.github`: information for running test workflows online (using Github Actions)
`R`: the core code. Holds many R scripts, including all modules of the model.
`analyses`: contains both scripts and output files. Scripts are meant to be applications using the modules of the code in `R`, or are otherwise relevant analyses, with output files for instance being figures and tables.
`data-raw`: input files.
`data`: empty folder to store processed data during runs.
`docs`: documentation.
`renv`: manages dependencies on other R packages.
`tests`: testing code that tests code, especially that in the `R` folder.

### Files
All other files are either for package, dependency, or version control management.

  - `collect-con-gap.R`: creates static, base year files, for total construction energy required for achieving full DLS (in MJ, and MJ/cap).
  - `dle_run.R`: script for running DLE bottom up calculations, making forward-looking bottom-up energy needs pathways (based on Kikstra et al. 2021, ERL publication).
  - `DLE_integration_data_structure.R` defines data structure of `DLE.dimension` and `DLE.scenario` objects.4r

# How to use


Below, we introduce how to use:
- DESIRE: assessing the energy availability for providing human needs in IAM scenarios
- DLE Scenario: creating a bottom-up scenario of how much energy is provided for supporting Decent Living Standards
- DLS current: creating static, base year files, for DLS deprivation headcount, DLS thresholds, and DLS gaps
- DLE current: creating static, base year files, for energy intensities, DLE per capita, DLE total, and new construction energy for full DLS (at current population) 

## DESIRE

### Default run (worked example)

To run the current version of DESIRE, open and run the `R\calculator_run.R` file in Rstudio.
Output in the form of figures and tables can be found in the folder `analyses`.

### Data notes:

Currently, none.

Data handling, especially of big files, may be changed in the future to better separate input data from the model structure.

### Changing input parameters

Input parameters can currently be found and edited in the  `calculator_input-options.R` scripts.

For one example, see `analyses/SHAPE_calculator_run-all-options.R`


## DLE scenario

### Default run (worked example)

To run the current version of the Decent Living Energy machinery (using the code from the `iiasa/DLE-scaleup` repository), open and run the `R\dle_run.R` file in Rstudio.
Output in the form of a scenario data file can be found in the folder `data`.

### Changing input parameters

Input parameters can currently be found and edited in the file `R\input-options.R`.
DLS thresholds can be flexibly specified in `dls_threshold_config.R`.


## DLS current

### Default scripts

#### Decent Living Standards
To extract static, base year files, for DLS deprivation headcount, DLS thresholds, DLS depth-of-deficits, and DLS gaps, run `collect-dls-gaps.R`. 
Output files are multiple, and can be found in the folder `data`.

#### Energy for DLS: energy intensities
To extract static, base year files, for the energy intensity of delivering DLS services, run `collect-ei.R`. 
Output files are multiple, and can be found in the folder `data`.

#### Energy for DLS: Decent Living Energy (DLE) threholds and gaps
To extract current DLE threshold estimates, run `collect-dle-threshold-input.R`.
To extract current energy development gap (DLE gap) estimates, run `collect-dle-gaps.R` (op + con.rep).
To extract an estimate of the energy required for new construction, run `collect-con-gap.R`.
Output files are multiple, and can be found in the folder `data`.

### Data notes:

All necessary input data should currently be available in the `data-raw` folder.

### Changing input parameters

DLS thresholds can be flexibly specified in `dls_threshold_config.R`.

For a worked example where multiple versions are created based on different threshold sets, see the `analyses/create_multiple_DLE_threshold_versions.R`.



# Information for developers (OUT OF DATE)

## Package dependencies

We use `renv` for handling and recording used dependencies.

### Installing dependencies

This is currently done in the `R/utils.R` script. The variable ENVIRONMENT is used to determine what set of packages is loaded, depending on your use-case, with "default" being the minimum to ensure functionality or the DLE and calculator modules. More packages (including for testing, plotting, and other development tools) can be loaded if necessary, with ENVIRONMENT<<-"dev" being the recommended setting for developers.

### Updating dependencies

When dependencies change, the lockfiles used by `renv` need to be updated, too. This can be done regularly, to keep up-to-date with packages. This must be done immediately if a new dependency is created, and is highly recommended to do immediately if a dependency is removed. 
For this, 
1. Add the new package to `R/dev/renv_dependencies.R`(choose if the package is part of the default, development, testing or plotting packages)
2. Run the script `R/dev/renv_create_lock.R`. 


## Code style

Before committing new commits, we would appreciate it if you run the function `clean_code_style()`

## Testing

To ensure that no aspects of the code break, we run the tests using `tests/testthat.R`.

Each code added should ideally come with new tests. 

### Running code tests locally

Either all in one go using `tests/testthat.R`, or one by one in the `tests/testthat/*.R` files. Running `tests/testthat.R` will result in output as shown below with some expected failing tests.

### Running code tests on GitHub Actions

Automated testing using a combination of GitHub Actions (to automatically test any PR to the main branch) and a self-hosted (IIASA) runner is planend.
It is possible that in the automated version, not all local tests can be run.
Therefore, running local tests remains advised.


### Updating test-data (expected output of integration tests)

Currently the following files need to be updated if something changes: 
- `tests/testthat/testdata/integration/expected/RESULTS-DLE-emulator-SHAPE-final.RData` 
  - how to update: run `tests/testthat/test-calculator_output-lognormal-calculation.R` and replace the file above (see variable `expected.output`) with the new outcome (see variable `received.output`)
- `tests/testthat/testdata/expected_outputs/DLS_dataproducts_combined.csv`
  - how to update: run `collect-dls-gaps.R` (using "default" config in `dls_threshold_config.R`) and replace the file above.

### Current expected test results
The code is still under development, and at times tests may not all be passing.
This holds especially for running the tests on GitHub Actions, which hasn't been made to fully work yet.

#### Online: GitHub Actions
The GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow is currently not running successfully.

#### Local: run tests/testthat.R manually

The tests are expected to pass locally.

Expected output of running `tests/testthat.R` is something like: 

```
